<h6>A Streaming Service Prediction and Analysis Tool</h6>
<h6>Abrstract</h6>
<p>The act of watching TV and movies is different in a way that itâ€™s never been before.  Streaming services have been popping up left and right over the past decade, and the selections available on any given streaming service will vary depending on the agreements negotiated between the service and the studios from which it buys its content.  Viewers must change their habits, but it is not intuitive to understand which streaming service is the best for each person.</p>

<p>We propose creating a site that leverages movie and TV show data, particularly ratings and genres, to give our user the tool he or she needs and to characterize each service according to the content preferences of the user.</p>

<h6>Structure</h6>
<ul>
<li>The landing page will present the user with a "predict" and "analyze" button.</li>
<li>"Analyze" will lead the user to a dashboard page with KIPs compairing various streaming services.</li>
<li>"Predict" wil take the user to an "interview" page where the user inputs their preferences.</li>
<li>Submitting the interview will take the user to a page that returns the best streaming services for them based on our analysis and their interview answers.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Datasets</h6>
<p>The original data sets for this project were downloaded from Kaggle. The data on Kaggle was scraped from Reelgood.com. Reelgood is a site that aggregates available movie and television data for all major streaming services.</p>
